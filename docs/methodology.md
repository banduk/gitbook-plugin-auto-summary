# PROCESS

## USER STORIES

When defining and scoping a product and its requirements, we do so by means of user stories, written from the perspective of those will end up using such product.

### Structure

Each user story will be written in the following structure:

* As a [user type], I want to [goal], so that I can [reason]

For example:

* As an admin, I want register on the site so I can have an account

### Size

Each user story should always only be written to achieve a single goal for a single user. When the goal itself is too broad or too vague, it must be broken up into several steps (i.e. more granular user stories). This is based on the circumstantial and collective decision of the Sprint team.

For example: ‘As an admin, I want to manage content on the site so I can edit everything’, can be too considered too broad a task. Instead, we will attempt to break it down further, into the likes of:

* As an admin, I want to manage blog articles so I can edit their content
* As an admin, I want to manage the media library so I can keep it up to date
* As an admin, I want to manage the about us page so it reflects our company correctly

And so forth.

### Structure

Each User Story is subjected to a detailed and thorough structure with the aim of clarifying its requirements, planning and solutions:

* Title - in the same structure aforementioned
* Description - detailed description and background to the user functionality required, with any further information relevant to it
* Requirements - list of granular requirements to satisfy the full functionality needed to fulfill the user journey
* Research (optional) - any relevant research around the user story and/or its proposed solution
* Insights (optional) - any relevant insights around the user story and/or its proposed solution
* Challenges (optional) - any challenges we might face in terms of satisfying the user story
* Solution - a top level plan of the solution proposed to satisfy the user story
* Tasks - granular tasks that collectively bring about the proposed solution
* Acceptance Criteria - checklist of criteria to test the implemented solution against that ensure all requirements have been met effectively

### Process

User stories will be captured in the form of cards on their respective project’s Trello board, by the Product Owner of the project.

The project leads will populate the story’s title, description and requirements, thereafter the developer(s) assigned to implementating the story will plan and populate its remaining sections required.

Lastly, the collective team will agree on a set of acceptance criteria to ensure the correct functionality of the solution throughout its development process.

### Implementation

Tasks defined within the user story should collectively fulfill the solution for it. They are then converted into their individual cards on the Sprint board, each one estimated by the respective developer and moves along the board as per the Sprint process.

Once all tasks are completed and approved, their parent user story moves along the board too.

## DISCOVERY

As the initial stage of every new project, the development team will undertake a discovery phase with the aim of setting the foundation of the project.

### Outcomes

The outcomes of this phase are as follow:

* Get a better grasp of the business, its objectives and customers, and how the proposed project fits within this bigger picture.
* Outline in detail the requirements of the project.
* Gather all required assets (content, logins, files etc.) that will be used for the project.
* Define the proposed solution and direction for the project.

### Process

The Discovery phase is broken down to a number of sub-exercises:

#### Initial Onboarding

Respective members of the development team will spend time with key stakeholders of the project to gather relevant as much information around the project in order to outline a detailed brief.

#### User Stories

Using the project requirements information obtained from the Initial Onboarding exercise, the team will convert these into structured user stories that collectively define the scope of the project. These require approval by relevant stakeholders prior to proceeding to the next exercise.

#### Wireframes

An assigned UX designer will put together detailed wireframes (for both desktop and mobile) that define the full scope of our solution (i.e. all of its proposed pages). These will go under review by key stakeholders and feedback will be applied directly to the wireframes rather than doing so at later phases of the project. These require approval by relevant stakeholder prior to proceeding to the next exercise.

#### User Testing

All wireframes are tested against five (or more) relevant users from target customer base to confirm direction and acquire further feedback. See User Testing section for more info.

#### Content gathering

Using the approved wireframes as a guiding reference, the responsible stakeholders will draft the relevant content (copy and imagery) necessary for the project, so it be made available prior to proceeding into the Design phase. In certain instances, where the project remains too unclear prior to having content, this step will be preliminary to the Wireframes exercise.

#### Project Scope consolidation

Finalize scope of work agreed to by all stakeholders by means of the Scope of Work Annexure of the Service Level Agreement.

### Software Considerations

* User Stories are captured on Trello to form of the Backlog of the project.
* Wireframes to be done in AxureXP or Sketch.
* Wireframes to be presented in Marvel or InVision.

### Consolidation

At the end of the discovery phase, we will be more equipped to conclude previous estimations, namely:

* Refine proposed project timing plan.
* Finalize associated project costs and revisit previous estimates given at the beginning of the project.

Once the Discovery phase comes to an end, all approved deliverables are considered to be final and any further changes further down the project timeline to such variables will be considered out of scope.

## DESIGN

The design phase applies creative direction to our proposed solution, defined through approved wireframes, and creates the final visual aesthetic components of the project.

### Outcomes

Define a design direction that will set the aesthetic tone for the front-end components of the project.
Prepare style guide and pattern library to be used during development for the project’s scope and future usage.

### Process

Exploration - assigned UX and UI designers familiarize themselves with the provided corporate identity, whether already in existence or one requiring evolvement. Thereafter, inspirations are gathered from similar projects and moodboards are created to capture relevant components to the project.
Initial Direction - designers then select a combination of 2-3 core components of the project (app screens, web pages, interactive features) and design 3 variations. Stakeholders will approve and select a direction, allowing the designer to reiterate it based on feedback (if any).
Style Guide and Pattern Library - upon completion of the designs, the final pattern library consisting of all individual components used in the designs needs to be organised and consolidated. A style guide will accompany it to give a snapshot overview of the rules used in the designs (fonts, colours, styles etc.). For a more detailed breakdown, refer to the Style Guide and Pattern Library sections.

### Transfer of assets

Final design assets need to be in form of open Photoshop files (PSD) or Sketch files (Sketch) that contain:

* Complete wireframes for all responsive states
* Design look & feel for the core interfaces of the project
* Detailed style guide defining design rules
* Pattern library of components/symbols of every individual assets required by the complete wireframes

### Software Considerations

When presenting designs, we are to use prototype tools (such Marvel and InVision) to mimic the behaviour of the solution and its interactivity.
Designs to be done in a software allowing for the creation of a pattern library and the overarching style guide, such as Sketch.IO.

### Process Considerations

Designers will work under the continuous supervision and guidance of an assigned Creative Director.
Assigned developers will to be kept in the loop and provide feedback and guidance during the key milestones of exercises listed.

## DEVELOP

Assigned developers take the approved designs and assets files and form a Sprint team to build the proposed solution and complete the project lifecycle.

### Outcomes

* Develop the backend foundation to the project.
* Develop the front-end UI of the project, based on approved designs.
* Test the solution thoroughly.
* Release it to market.

### Exercises

* Set the foundation - a week of preparation for the project where the team defines technologies to be used and sets them up, first Sprint is planned and required infrastructure and services are implemented.
* Development Sprints - developers work alone or in pairs through a series of pre-allocated sprints to complete the development portion of the project. See the Sprints section for more info.
* Quality Assurance and Testing - a closing week dedicated to final testing of proposed solution prior to deploying it live. Involves all stakeholder. See Quality Assurance section for more info.
* Go  live - The project is deployed to a production environment and considered released.

### Process Considerations

* Assigned Product Owner will coordinate and facilitate the Development phase and its sub-exercises.
