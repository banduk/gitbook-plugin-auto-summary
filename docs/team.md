# TEAM

## COMMUNICATION

We encourage more general discussion in public channels on Slack such as #dev-team than direct messages. It's a shift in a direction that will improve our transparency and communication as the team grows and something that we can implement at an early stage and benefit from.

Obviously there is some discussion that warrants a direct message, but very little. Even if discussing something you think is not relevant to anyone else, do it in a public forum and they may be able to contribute.

It will also improve on our transparency on days like Work-From-Home-Wednesdays.

At the end of the day, everyone in the loop and discussing / contributing is better than not. Be conscious about it moving forward and keep that communication flowing.

## WORK TIME

Our typical working hours are from 09:00 till 17:00. We do cater for anyone who lives a little bit further out of town so they do not have to sit in traffic. In this situation, work times are shifted by an hour or so for that person specifically.

We try our hardest to avoid having anyone work overtime and take this into account during our sprint and project planning. That being said, we try and create a culture where if push comes to shove and something unavoidable arises, team members may need to help out for the good of the rest of the team.

## LEAVE & HOLIDAYS

There is no set amount of leave you can take and we encourage taking leave to go on holiday or get some time away every now and then.

## WORKSTATIONS

We provide a top of the range MacBook Pro for all members of the team. These machines are for you to do with as you please, but remain property of MADE Agency and are insured under MADE's insurance policy. All we ask is that you keep the machine clean, and the screen scratch free.

## LICENSED SOFTWARE

We provide software licenses for any justifiable software that you may need to enhance your productivity. We do not believe or condone piracy and therefore encourage the use of licensed software.

- Sketch
- Sublime Text
- Adobe Creative Cloud
- etc.

If you feel like there is a piece of software that may benefit you individually or the team as a whole, present its case, we love to play with new tools.

## PERSONAL BACKUPS

For day to day storage, all of our Google Apps accounts come with unlimited storage space. You can make use of this at any time and to store whatever you need. Backup is good, don't get caught out.


## PASSWORDS & SECURITY

Almost all of the tools we use and also access to the properties we work on are stored in 1Password. This is a mandatory and keeps things running smoothly, as well as maintains a level of security.

We aim to keep all passwords and logins in 1Password up to date at all times, making it easier for everyone in the team and instilling a level of confidence in using 1Password on a day to day basis. This includes keeping it up to date with all properties/logins which anyone in the team might need at any stage.

1Password also comes with a Personal vault, which you are welcome to use for your personal logins. We/anyone else obviously don't have access to this vault.
