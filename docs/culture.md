# CULTURE

## WHAT WE ENJOY

We specialize in Ruby on Rails, Elixir/Phoenix and React/React Native. We believe strongly in these two languages and are very confident in any product that is built using them. Our typical approach is a decoupled architecture where the backend and frontend are both modular and separate code bases, interacting by the frontend consuming a RESTful API served by the backend.

We find this approach gives us the benefits of a 'micro-service' architecture as well as modular and more maintainable codebase(s). This approach works well for both web and mobile applications.

## MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES

- The basis of every action we take is the product.
- We don’t sacrifice on quality and strive to produce epic work for both ourselves and our client.
- Hire good people and get out of their way. This is a management philosophy that we hold to be very true on daily basis.
- We only hire people we believe are extremely talented at what they do as well as have a passion for the craft and that are keen to expand their knowledge. We do not have a B team.
- We believe product is paramount and comes first. ~~Customer~~ product is king.
- It's not official until it’s in the source code.

## COLLABORATION

Our environment is very open and our organisational structure is very flat. All opinions matter and no one should ever feel like they cannot contribute or have a say in any of the goings on within the department. We like to work in an environment where If you need help from someone or want to help someone else it's a regular occurrence.

## LEARNING

We encourage learning and keeping up to date with new technology. We do not fear new technology, we endorse it. We won't necessarily jump into a new framework that is pre-release and not mature enough, however these decisions can easily be made when working with a new technology.

We have subscriptions to the following tutorial and online learning platforms which anyone is able to use (can be found on 1Password):

EggHead.io -  Bite-size video tutorials for badass web developers. Learn the latest frameworks from industry pros.

If there is a resource or a course you would like to use to further your knowledge, we are happy to add it to this list of resources above or arrange for members of the team to take part in courses.

## WORK-FROM-HOME-WEDNESDAYS

On Wednesdays we give the team the opportunity to work from home. The idea is that the team will work a normal working day and by working from home or a coffee shop or wherever it might be, it will allow people break up their week and increace productivity and focus.

The idea isn't that this day becomes a day to go and take care of chores, its a opportunity to work from the comfort of your home and really get some distraction free time.
